# Portfolio

## Description

* I wanted to design a portfolio showcasing my work to potential employers

* It was a challenge to align the elements in a way that I wanted, and also make those elements functional

* I have learned that simple and intuitive is the best approach to design, and I would like to totally re-design this portfolio with that in mind

* In the future I'd like to implement more clean and better features to this page. I want to add more projects, get things aligned and designed in a more pleasing way, and add some small QOL features regarding the layout
